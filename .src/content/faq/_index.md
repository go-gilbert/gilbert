## Kube looks awesome. Who is it for?

We designed Kube as a small and inconspicuous helper for the professional developers and designers. Why an emphasis on “professional”? Well, because Kube is neither a kit of ready elements nor a set of templates; Kube is mainly a tool, which helps to keep routine tasks to a minimum. Kube doesn’t impose its own styles and doesn’t require following any specific design rules or practices. It makes Kube ideal for creative and challenging tasks of making unique websites with the unique design. For those who know HTML/CSS/JS inside out, Kube may become an irreplaceable tool that saves countless hours of work.

If you are new to HTML/CSS/JS, then you may have a hard time implementing Kube in your projects, and it may just not be a tool for you yet. But certainly feel free to download and explore Kube, and see where this journey will take you!

## What? Where’s the Nav Bar and other navigation?

With over 15 years of web development experience under the belt, we can assure you that Nav Bars and all other sorts of navigational elements are always faster and easier to build for a project from scratch than to modify, customize and rebuild an existing solution.

Each and every project has its unique navigational needs and often requires more of a custom approach. Vast experience shows that writing code for navigation from ground up is less time-consuming and more efficient, than tweaking and creating the navigation based on a boilerplate solution.

## Isn’t it a great idea to add some awesome features to Kube?

Nope. We want to keep Kube minimalistic, small and flexible. So, actually, there’s more chance of us removing stuff from the code and functions while preserving features, than adding new code and new stuff.

## What Does the Future Hold for Kube? What’s the plan?

Right now, Kube is a self-sufficient, modern and complete product. We have no specific plans of adding any new components anytime soon; we do not plan to extend Kube as well. Our goal is to improve the things that make Kube so awesome by squashing bugs, refactoring the code and improving overall performance.

Having this said, we are keeping our eyes on what’s new in the world of HTML, CSS, and JS, and if something truly exciting happens in future with these technologies (comparable, let’s say, to flexbox emergence), we most certainly will consider these changes and will be first to go ahead and implement them as soon as possible.

## I’m using old Kube. How do I download it again, and where do I find old Documentation?

Old versions of Kube are critically outdated, and we strongly encourage you to stop using them as soon as you can. We do not offer old versions for download, and we do not provide old documentation. We realize that this may be an inconvenience, however, we also deeply believe that upgrading to the new Kube will bring way greater positive effect to your projects than the ability to support legacy versions.

## How do I migrate from an older version to the latest one?

Basically, you take the new Kube and start afresh from scratch. The old Kube had been built on a completely different set of principles and technologies, and it is pretty much incompatible with the new Kube in every way. Starting anew with the new Kube will also give you an opportunity to reevaluate your project in a new light and improve it in general.

## Can I create design themes for sale based on Kube?

You absolutely can! You have our permission to use Kube in whatever projects you wish commercial, for sale, or otherwise, in whichever way you like.
